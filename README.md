# Dropbox-bulk-conflict-resolver
if you are like me you've probably stored code in dropbox only to find out that when you wake up another computer you work on Dropbox thinks those are the new changes, when they really are not. This creates a huge mess of conflict files that need to be resolved somehow. So I've created a script to help with this.  


## Use With Caution!!!
I've only used this tool on my own a few times, so please use with cation, and pleas do a dry run before you actually use it if you do not fully understand what it does. I also recomend that you stop dropbox while using this, incase you make any really bad mistakes. 

## Contributions are welcome! 
if you'd like to add to this or make a change pleas send me a pull request.
