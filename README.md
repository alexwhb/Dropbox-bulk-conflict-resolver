# Dropbox-bulk-conflict-resolver
if you are like me you've probably stored code in dropbox only to find out that when you wake up another computer you work on Dropbox thinks those are the new changes, when they really are not. This creates a huge mess of conflict files that need to be resolved somehow. So I've created a script to help with this.
